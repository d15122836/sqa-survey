Feedbacks are the responses given out by the customers to the service providers. It helps the service providers to improve or maintain the quality of services. Therefore, in our project we have developed an application which provides certain functionalities such as creating surveys, calculating the responses, list surveys etc.. In the documentation, we have explained how the given objective of creating such application is achieved following an industry standard software development approach.

## Components

An industry standard software development approach includes various components that needs to be cleary defined before writing the code. Therefore, we have defined following components prior to writing the code.

1. Road Map
2. Software Development Model

3. Backlog Refinement
4. Unit Testing
5. Code coverage tool
6. Team version control
7. Code Review
